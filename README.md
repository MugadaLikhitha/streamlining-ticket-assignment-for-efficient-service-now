# Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations ServiceNow

This project implements a structured and automated approach to streamline ticket assignment in **ServiceNow**.
It ensures issues are routed to the correct groups automatically, reducing manual effort and improving turnaround time.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Service requests often involve repetitive manual assignment of tickets, which can delay resolution and introduce errors. This project introduces a systematic workflow that:

- Defines users, groups, and roles for access management  
- Creates a custom table to track operations-related issues  
- Implements secure access through roles and ACLs  
- Automates ticket routing using Flow Designer  


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Establish clear user, group, and role structures  
- Secure custom data tables with proper access controls  
- Automate issue assignment to the right teams  
- Reduce manual intervention and enhance service efficiency  


## âœ¨ Key Features

### Users, Groups, and Roles Setup
- Created new **users** with unique details  
- Defined **groups** for access separation  
- Configured **roles** for platform and certification responsibilities  
- Linked users to appropriate groups and roles  


### Custom Table for Operations Issues
- Built a custom table `Operations Related` to track service issues  
- Enabled **Create module** and **mobile module** for accessibility  
- Defined structured fields and issue choices:
  - Unable to login to platform  
  - 404 Error  
  - Regarding certificates  
  - Regarding user expired  
- Configured table access restricted to **Platform** and **Certification** roles  


### Access Control Configuration
- Applied **ACLs** for role-based security  
- Restricted read/write operations to authorized roles  
- Used **elevated Security Admin role** for updates  
- Ensured granular control with field-specific ACLs  



### Flow Designer Automation
- Automated assignment of tickets based on issue type  
- **Flow 1 â€“ Certificates Issues**  
  - Trigger: Create/Update record on `Operations Related` table  
  - Condition: Issue = Regarding Certificates  
  - Action: Assign to **Certificates Group**  

- **Flow 2 â€“ Platform Issues**  
  - Trigger: Create/Update record on `Operations Related` table  
  - Conditions:  
    - Unable to login to platform  
    - 404 Error  
    - Regarding User expired  
  - Action: Assign to **Platform Group**  

- Saved and activated flows for seamless automation  

##âœ… Conclusion

This project successfully streamlines the ticket assignment process in ServiceNow by combining structured access management, secure ACL configurations, and Flow Designer automation.

With this implementation:

Tickets are automatically routed to the appropriate teams, eliminating manual intervention
Service delivery is faster, more accurate, and less prone to errors
Roles and ACLs ensure proper data security and access control
